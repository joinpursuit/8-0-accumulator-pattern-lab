# Accumulator Pattern Lab

A fan of the classic _Creatures & Catacombs_ game, your friend has asked you to build some functions that will help calculate and search through dice rolls. Help them speed up their game by applying the accumulator pattern in your algorithms.

## Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory on your command line. Then, run the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This will install the libraries needed to run the tests.

1. Open up the repository in VSCode. Follow the instructions below to complete the Lab.

## Instructions

You will complete four functions in the `index.js` file which will require you to apply the accumulator pattern to an array of numbers. Each time `rolls` is mentioned, it refers to an array of numbers.

```js
const rolls = [2, 4, 5, 2];
```

All of the numbers will be greater than 0.

Use the comments and tests to determine what each function needs to do.

### Tests

To run the tests, you can run the following command from the command line. You will need to be in the root directory of your repository.

```
npm test
```

This will run the test output once.

#### Test watcher

If you'd like, you can have the tests run constantly. This means that each time you save your file, your tests will re-run. To do so, you can run the following:

```
npm run watch
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to exit out of the constant runner.
